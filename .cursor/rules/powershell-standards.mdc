# PowerShell Toolkit Standards

## Code Standards

- Every function must include a `<# .SYNOPSIS #>` block for the `??` dashboard
- Use `Write-Host` with colors for dashboard-style output
- Handle long Windows paths using `-LiteralPath`
- PowerShell 5.1 compatible (no ternary operators `? :`)
- Format sizes in GB/MB using SI units

## User Feedback (MANDATORY)

- ALWAYS show progress/status during operations
- Colors: Green=success, Yellow=warning, Red=error, Cyan=info
- Display operation summaries (items processed, time elapsed, results count)
- Never run silent operations

## Documentation (MANDATORY)

- ALWAYS update `README.md` when adding/modifying/removing functions
- Document under appropriate section (Core/Dev/Media)
- Keep descriptions concise (one line, action-oriented)
- Update folder structure in README when creating new files/folders

## Folder Structure

- `core/`: System utilities, timers, dashboard components
- `dev/`: Development tools, port management, navigation
- `media/`: File/video library management

## Helper Functions

- Internal/helper functions go in `core/Helpers.ps1`, NOT in feature files
- `Helpers.ps1` is loaded first by `loader.ps1` and excluded from `??` dashboard
- Feature files should only contain user-facing functions
- Each feature module with commands should have a help function (e.g., `timer` shows timer help)
